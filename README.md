# Belly_Button_Biodiversity

### The project is about the research on belly button bacterial data. Volunteers who participated in this research had the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons identified. This way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, the volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel. 

### Data from samples.json file are used and a dashboard is built to represend the result.
